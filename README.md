# Restricted Routes
## USER INFO

### Displays user profile if logged in
#### GET /api/user/:id
Example: User 1 logs in >> /api/profile/1

Server will return
```
{
  "id": 1,
  "first_name": "Paul",
  "last_name": "Holes"
{
```
### Edit user profile
#### PUT /api/user/:id

User can edit
```
{
  "first_name": "Paul",
  "last_name": "Holes"
{
```
### Delete user profile
#### DELETE /api/user/:id

Server will respond status 204 if successful
I'd suggest showing some kind of success message/alert on the front end, before rerouting.
